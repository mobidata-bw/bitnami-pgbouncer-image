# [pgbouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org) Docker image

In September 2025, [bitnami deprecated many of their official `docker.io/bitnami/*` images](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/issues/83267). Given that the [`docker.io/bitnamilegacy/pgbouncer` image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnamilegacy/pgbouncer) won't be updated anymore, we **use this repo to continuously build and publish our own [`ghcr.io/mobidata-bw/pgbouncer` image](https://github.com/orgs/mobidata-bw/packages/container/package/pgbouncer)** from the same source code.
